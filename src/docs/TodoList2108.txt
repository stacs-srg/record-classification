Machine Learning Todo List
21/08/14

Coding:
Finish coding of explicit pipelines (2 x experimental pipelines, 2 x production pipelines) - PRIMARY
Exploit nature of cross fold experiments to produce estimate of model quality after training but before classification. - SECONDARY
Ability to train on new data with a bigger dictionary than initial training data (model cardinality). TERTIARY


Experimentation and Outputs
Initial run with the pilot data - complete waiting on info on how to transfer to Zen - PRIMARY
Run time estimates for classification and for training - SECONDARY
Continue tweaking of loss functions after assessment of initial experiments and coding runs - PRIMARY
Comparison of how precision varies with confidence -SECONDARY


Documentation
High level user documentation describing how to download, install and run the system.- PRIMARY
High level user documentation describing the different major algorithms and where they are and how they interact.- PRIMARY
FAQ page for the website addressing common questions the user may have - SECONDARY
Low level javadoc - mostly complete ONGOING

Papers
Springer book chapter - due end of October - PRIMARY
Possible paper on multiple classifications and LDA/HMM/Current approach  - SECONDARY
