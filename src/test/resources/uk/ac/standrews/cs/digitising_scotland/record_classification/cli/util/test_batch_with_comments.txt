# Step 1: initialise classli and replace any existing configuration folder
init -f

# Step 2: set the classifier to VOTING_ENSEMBLE_EXACT_ML_SIMILARITY
set --classifier VOTING_ENSEMBLE_EXACT_ML_SIMILARITY

# Step 3: load gold standard data from gs_cambridge.csv file at the current working directory, and skip header record,
#          where 100% of records are used for training.
load --from "path/to/data/with spaces in path/gs.csv" gold_standard -h -t 1.0

# Step 4: load gold standard data from gs_hisco.csv file at the current working directory, and skip header record,
#          where 100% of records are used for training.
load --from path/to/data/without_spaces/gs.csv gold_standard -h -t 1.0

# Step 5: load unseen data from Occupation1939forStA.txt file at the current working directory, and skip header record,
#         where values are seperated by pipe character (i.e. '|').
load --from "some badly named file with spaces.txt" unseen -h -d "|"

# Step 6: clean loaded gold standard and unseen data using all the predefined cleaners.
clean -c COMBINED

# Step 7: train the classifier using all the loaded and cleaned gold standard data.
train

# Step 8: classify the unseen records and store the classified records in a file called classified_Occupation1939forStA.csv
#         at the current working directory. 
classify -o "classified_some other file.csv"
